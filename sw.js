// Bump this when a client-side feature or data-sync fix ships so installed
// PWAs replace stale scripts instead of continuing to run an older client.
// v81: premium historical-maps accordion releases its max-height after the
// expand animation so the last card (Galiția & Lodomeria 1855) can no longer
// be clipped in the standalone mobile PWA.
// v82: fix PWA Patrimoniu zoom glitch — stop redrawing custom canvases
// during pinch/zoom animation, round transform to match tile container,
// and guard visualViewport resize while zooming.
// v84: offline-maps panel — zoom-level wording ("Nivel zoom" / "Zoom level"),
// closing a polygon on its first corner, the over-sized-polygon error that was
// being overwritten, and panel/bottom-bar/status-bar geometry in the PWA.
// v85: Satellite layer "Istoric" period slider — 2016 / 2018 orthophotos
// (geo-spatial.org WMS) alongside the present-day imagery, with both vertical
// mirrors (opacity + period) shown together on the map.
// v86: Social layer — "Prieteni / Friends" (search by e-mail · name · id +
// county filter), friend requests, private and group chat with an admin,
// events created straight from a chat and the "Adaugă prieteni / Add friends"
// box of the create-event form, all bounded by the quotas in public.app_limits.
// v87: Visibility prompt — turning ON the Detect switch or the live-location
// button now asks "Vrei să fii vizibil și pentru alți utilizatori?" (Da/Nu);
// the answer gates every presence publish so users are only shown to other
// detectorists after an explicit "Da".
// v89: Satellite „Istoric” keeps only the 2016 orthophoto (the 2018 layer is
// removed from the base layer → two stops, 2016 / 2025) and the two
// map-side mirrors of the Satellite layer stay side by side in the installed
// PWA / on phones, where the ≤600px breakpoint used to stack them on the same
// anchor so only the ISTORIC mirror was visible.
// v90: the map-side opacity mirror no longer prints the word "OPACITY" above
// the range — the slider shows the layer name only (period mirrors keep
// ISTORIC / PERIOADĂ).
// v95: layer info for "Harta Transilvaniei 1859" and "Hartă administrativă a
// Galiției și Lodomeriei – 1855" also credits the digitization and publication
// by Universitatea „Ștefan cel Mare” din Suceava, with bukowina1856.eu as the
// source (ⓘ popup, Leaflet attribution, offline-maps panel). The source domain
// is rendered as a clickable link inside the ⓘ popup.
// v98: PWA layer panel + analysis sliders + detectorist social fixes —
//   • the layers window is anchored top→bottom of the map frame (it used to be
//     capped at 560px, so in the installed PWA it stopped after the lower half
//     of the screen) and carries no bottom padding any more;
//   • a mirrored vertical slider shows its layer title ABOVE the card instead of
//     inside it, and the LIDAR / potential / report ranges take the colour of the
//     pin + radius circle of their own layer (green / purple / blue);
//   • the magnifier only starts the live location — it no longer switches the
//     detection mode on — and being visible to others now depends on live
//     location + consent alone;
//   • tapping a detectorist pin always offers the friend action (Leaflet's
//     popup.update() used to repaint the string content over the buttons, so the
//     button appeared only when it lost that race);
//   • the friends search browses the county on an empty query, searches while you
//     type, reads the tables the RLS already exposes when the search RPC is
//     missing, and says so when the server could not be reached
//     (supabase/migrations/20260916020000_social_directory_projection.sql);
//   • offline areas are drawn as a polygon only — no vertex pins, no radius
//     circles, and the analysis layers never drop their pin under the finger
//     while a ring is being drawn — plus a centred ✕ at the bottom that leaves
//     an active offline map.
// v100: tile performance governor — js/tile-perf.js (loaded right after Leaflet)
//   applies gesture-safe defaults to every tile layer, merges the tile work of a
//   fast zoom into one update per layer, prunes the old zoom levels harder and
//   watches the page's decoded-tile budget; it is what stops the crash/reload
//   reported with several dense layers open at once (LIDAR + „Imagini
//   satelitare anii 60'" + historical maps + APM) when zooming abruptly.
//   See MAP_LAYER_PERFORMANCE.md.
// v103: friends panel — the unified search and the friend list each get their
//   own tab („Caută prieteni” / „Prietenii tăi”; the empty friend list carries
//   a button straight to the search), and the chat view with a friend clears
//   the phone status bar in the installed PWA (safe-area top padding, same
//   rule as the event chat) so ← / ⋯ / 📅 stay tappable. The map guide
//   (js/tutorial.js) opens the search tab and points at the new tabs.
// v105: fluid zoom — shorter settle window, covering tiles until the new
//   zoom is active, keepBuffer 1/2, dark map background so empty tiles no
//   longer flash white. See MAP_LAYER_PERFORMANCE.md.
// v107: "Zone cu potențial arheologic" — the heatmap now matches the bubbles:
//   the score raster is copied north-up into the source bitmap (it used to be
//   mirrored N–S, so colours and the transparent exclusion holes landed on
//   the opposite side of the circle, in places that are neither UAT nor a
//   site radius); the separate "Mod pin" switch is removed — the map-point
//   logic (tap → purple pin) is permanent while the layer's main switch is on
//   (the radius mirror + dock now follow that switch), and the layer info
//   text is replaced. See ARCHEO_POTENTIAL.md.
// v108: seamless tiles — the white grid between tiles is gone (Leaflet's
//   mix-blend-mode: plus-lighter added the colours of the 1px seam overlap
//   instead of covering them, so every 256px line lit up white) and zoom
//   in/out now cross-fades the incoming tiles over the previous zoom level
//   through a CSS-only fade on every device — same crash protection, no
//   hard pop. See MAP_LAYER_PERFORMANCE.md.
// v109: no dark strip below the map in the installed PWA — #map-section no
//   longer computes its height from vh/svh/dvh (iOS standalone settles those
//   one frame late, and on some versions the dynamic viewport excludes the
//   home-indicator band, so the section could end up shorter than the screen
//   and the navy page background showed as an empty "bottom bar" under the
//   tiles). It now stretches between the viewport edges (top:0 + bottom:0),
//   and delayed passes + a ResizeObserver re-run Leaflet's invalidateSize the
//   exact frame the container reaches its real size. No control moves.
// v110: social notifications — the red badge moves onto the PROFILE BUTTON and
//   counts everything at once (unread event chats from js/events.js + pending
//   friend requests + unread messages from js/friends.js, both writing through
//   window.DetectLabNotify so neither erases the other), and a new friend
//   request or a new chat message pops a notification card in the top-right
//   corner (tap = open that request tab / that thread, ✕ = dismiss, hidden
//   forever once seen — the marks live in the per-account mirror). Messages
//   arrive instantly through a realtime inbox channel; requests through the
//   20 s counter poll. See FRIENDS_AND_CHAT.md.
// v111: offline maps — the download cap grows from 10 km² to 100 km² (tile
//   budget raised with it) and the free catalogue gains Patrimoniu (CIMEC
//   WMS), the three free eharta historical maps (Austriacă 1910, Planuri de
//   Tragere 20k, Sovietică 1970) and Localități OSM (the GeoJSON is cached as
//   one document and replayed as name labels). sw.js now treats every
//   request tagged with __dl_offline_map= as an offline-cache lookup so WMS
//   tiles and the cached GeoJSON also work with no connection.
// v112: the dark band under the map in the installed iPhone PWA — root cause
//   found. `#map-section` is position:fixed, so top:0 / bottom:0 resolve
//   against the initial containing block, and this page asks iOS for the one
//   viewport documented to come up short there: viewport-fit=cover +
//   apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style:black-translucent + a document sized
//   in % / svh / dvh. WebKit then hands the page an ICB that is
//   safe-area-inset-top (~59px) shorter than the physical screen — content is
//   laid out from y=0 behind the translucent status bar but the box height is
//   never compensated — so bottom:0 stops ~59px above the bottom edge, the map
//   container ends there, the "© Leafleet" tag sits on top of the gap and the
//   empty #060E1E page background shows through under it as the "bottom
//   padding / bottom bar". Every reading of the ICB is short by the same
//   amount (%, svh, dvh and bottom:0 alike), which is why v109's ladder →
//   stretch rewrite did not remove it. 100vh is the one unit WebKit resolves to
//   the FULL screen in this mode, so #map-section and .transp-panel now carry
//   min-height:100vh as a floor: where the ICB already equals the screen
//   (Android, desktop ?pwa=1, iOS without the short-ICB behaviour) it is
//   exactly the top:0→bottom:0 stretch and changes nothing; where the ICB is
//   short it clamps the box back to the real screen height. No control offset
//   is touched. Also ships js/pwa-debug.js — a gated on-device probe
//   (?pwaDebug=1 / ?pwaDebug=colors, or five taps on the © Leafleet tag) that
//   prints the ICB / 100vh / dvh / svh / env() / element rects and can copy the
//   whole readout, plus paints each candidate layer a different colour so the
//   band's own colour names its painter in one round trip. See
//   PWA_BOTTOM_BAND.md.
// v113: keep event creation below the phone status bar and within the viewport.
// v115: move the Battles epoch-colour legend from the layers panel into the
// Battles info tab, directly below its attribution.
// v116: layer-card initials — the mirrored layer cards (analysis sliders +
//   the PWA layer panel) fall back to the layer's initials when the icon is
//   missing, so no card is painted with an empty header.
// v117: visibility prompt on the nearby search — tapping „Da / Yes” in „Vezi
//   alți detectoriști în zonă” now asks the SAME question as the Detect switch
//   („Vrei să fii vizibil și pentru alți utilizatori?”, Da/Nu) before anything
//   is published: the search waits for the answer, the search dialog steps
//   aside for the question and returns with it, and the answer is applied
//   through _presenceVisible() („Nu” still searches — you just stay invisible).
// v118: PWA bottom band — the inner percentage chain (.container → .map-frame →
//   .map-wrapper → #detectlab-map) was still min-height:100% so it inherited the
//   short ICB (785px on an 844px screen) even after #map-section got the 100vh
//   floor; the © Leafleet tag sat on top of the gap and #060E1E showed through.
//   All four inner boxes now carry min-height:100vh as well, closing the band
//   without moving any control offset. See PWA_BOTTOM_BAND.md.
// v119: PWA bottom band, take two — 100vh itself is still a CSS-unit reading of
//   the same short ICB on some iOS/Android builds, so v118's floor could still
//   come up short there. #map-section / .map-frame / .map-wrapper /
//   #detectlab-map / .transp-panel / .container now also take a JS-measured
//   `--dl-vvh` pixel floor (window.innerHeight / visualViewport.height, which
//   already reports the true physical screen height in that mode) as a second
//   `min-height` line after the plain 100vh one — CSS keeps the last
//   `min-height` that resolves to a real length, so this only raises the floor
//   when 100vh itself was short, and changes nothing where it already matched
//   the screen. No control offset moved. See PWA_BOTTOM_BAND.md.
// v121: the standalone PWA gives the map-side layer title an explicit column
//   and a concrete rotated label box, avoiding the mobile WebView auto-grid
//   collapse that could leave the initials outside the visible card.
// v122: two independent layer mirrors can stay on the map at once. The
//   Satellite base remains the deliberate two-slider pair (opacity + historic
//   period), while other selected layers use the two map-side slots and mark
//   their rows as already represented on the map.
// v123: the PWA bottom bar is GONE. The installed app showed a strip at the
//   bottom of the screen — the bottom-right floating stack (#pwa-br-stack):
//   the geolocation / live-location 🎯 button above the account trigger (the
//   button showing the e-mail initials, "AN", or the "Log In" pill) with its
//   upward dropdown (Manage Account / Events / Friends / Language / Storage /
//   Log Out). The container is display:none !important, it is removed() from
//   the DOM by the standalone script, and js/map-app.js no longer builds the
//   live-location button in PWA mode — so the map now runs to the bottom edge
//   with no bar and no buttons under it. The left icon stack (zoom, measure,
//   coordinates, trail, offline maps, magnifier), the compass / rotation-lock /
//   Detect column and the "© Leafleet" tag are untouched.
// v125: PWA shell refresh — index.html now re-checks for a new sw.js after
//   load, on pageshow, on foregrounding and every minute, and reloads once a
//   NEW worker takes control over an OLD one. Installed apps used to keep
//   running their opening shell (WebView snapshot) for days, so map changes
//   already shipped — two layer sliders on screen (v122) and the layer title
//   written beside the vertical mirror (v121) — never surfaced in the PWA
//   even after deploy. The corrupt trailing bytes after index.html's </html>
//   are gone as well, so the document parses as one clean unit again.
// v126: mobile WEB fullscreen control clearance (browser tab, not the
//   installed PWA). The bottom-left compass + rotation-lock column was hidden
//   behind the browser's bottom search/URL bar in map fullscreen — the frame
//   is `inset:0; height:100vh` and 100vh is the LARGE viewport, so the map's
//   bottom edge (and every absolute control on it) slides under the browser
//   toolbar — and the "?" help button slid against the map search bar because
//   the desktop fullscreen offset (right:64px, clearing the ✕) also applied
//   on phones where the ✕ lives at the bottom-right instead. The bottom-left
//   corner now fixes to the visible viewport above the browser bar, and the
//   "?" stays pinned in the top-right corner on narrow screens.
// v127: layer quick actions in BOTH vertical mirrors. The docked icon rules
//   (APM 2.0 „Ajutor de căutare” + the three Iosefină Premium buttons) were
//   scoped to `#verticalOpacityActions …`, so when a layer was mirrored into
//   the SECOND on-screen slider (#verticalOpacityActionsSecondary) its buttons
//   kept the floating bottom-center geometry from their base rules
//   (position:absolute, bottom:76px, left:50%, translateX(±112px)) — out of the
//   column, overlapping and off to the left of the slider. The selectors now
//   key off the shared `.vertical-opacity-actions` container class. The bump
//   matters for the installed PWA, which serves the shell from this cache.
// v129: closing a DISTANCE mirror (LIDAR Scanner / Zone cu potențial
//   arheologic / Raport arheologic) that sits on the map as the SECOND
//   slider no longer closes the OTHER mirror and deactivates its layer.
//   The analysis modules used to call the global mirror close()
//   (closeAllControls) when their layer switched off — which happens INSIDE
//   their own mirror's teardown, because clearSlot re-fires the layer
//   switch's change event — so everything on the map went dark together.
//   They now call the new single-slot closeFor(id) API, and isActiveFor(id)
//   no longer reports the slot that is currently being torn down.
// v130: the DISTANȚĂ / RAZĂ / ISTORIC caption chip floats ABOVE the vertical
//   slider card in the installed PWA too. The chip lived inside
//   .vertical-opacity-title; in the PWA that wrapper is absolutely positioned
//   (rotated side-title fallback), so it became the chip's containing block
//   and dragged DISTANȚĂ down onto the top edge of the card, over the ×
//   button. The chip is now a direct child of the card (index.html) and the
//   stylesheet is re-versioned. The bump also pushes every installed app onto
//   a shell where the mirrored-row „PE HARTĂ / ON MAP” badge is gone (removed
//   in v124 — a stale cached shell was the only way to still see it).
// v131: the ✕ that closes a map-side slider is finally hittable on desktop.
//   ROOT CAUSE: without a z-index, the positioned .vertical-opacity-slider-
//   wrap (later in the DOM) painted OVER the bottom half of the absolutely-
//   positioned 22×22 transparent button and swallowed its clicks — only a
//   thin strip above the card was ever clickable, so closing a mirror took
//   several aim-and-click attempts. The button now paints above the wrap
//   (z-index: 2), grew to 26×26 with a visible disc, carries an invisible
//   ::before halo that grows the click target to ~40px (WCAG 2.5.8; the
//   halo overhangs the card edge, which has no overflow:hidden, and stays
//   clear of the slider's top end), lights up as soon as the cursor enters
//   the card, and scales up on hover/focus (disabled under
//   prefers-reduced-motion). Stylesheet and shell re-versioned.
// v132: în aplicația instalată (și pe orice ecran tactil) oglinda unui strat
//   se adaugă pe ecran DOAR la un tap deliberat pe cardul stratului. Înainte,
//   orice atingere a unui range din panou — inclusiv degetul care aluneca
//   peste el în timp ce derulai lista — selecta stratul prin pointerdown /
//   focus, arunca oglinda pe hartă și aprindea stratul; la fel, orice clic pe
//   card (chiar și cel produs la capătul unei derulări) închidea panoul și
//   aprindea stratul. Acum atingerea unui slider doar alimentează o oglindă
//   aflată deja pe ecran, iar tapul pe card este ignorat dacă gestul a fost o
//   derulare (deplasare peste prag, panou derulat între apăsare și ridicare,
//   tap care doar oprește o derulare, al doilea deget, apăsare lungă). Pe
//   desktop, în afara modului PWA, comportamentul rămâne neschimbat.
// v133: readuce butonul 🎯 de locație live în PWA ca un control fix separat
//   în dreapta-jos (safe-area + 28px), fără să readucă meniul contului din
//   vechea stivă de jos; site-ul păstrează butonul în coloana din stânga.
// v134: RAZĂ / DISTANȚĂ / ISTORIC rămâne vizibil deasupra oglinzii verticale
//   și în landscape (max-height ≤500px) — regula display:none care ascundea
//   cipul pe ecrane scurte e scoasă, la cererea explicită a utilizatorului
//   („cuvântul raza ... trebuie să apară deasupra lor când sunt adăugate”).
// v135: extinde v134 și pentru PERIOADĂ din stratul Bătălii — același
//   tratament: cip-ul rămâne vizibil în landscape, deasupra oglinzii.
